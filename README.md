#### Case

* As a developer, I want to know changes do not break my code. I want all functions (except the main entrypoint) unit tested.
* As a developer, I want classes and functions to have a clear purpose with documentation on what they do, not how they do it.

* As a product owner, I want the team to work in a way most appropriate for the team.
* As a developer, I want to know when something breaks but I want to show a friendlier message to the user.
* As a developer, I want to have a clear code structure.
